# DOM Class Frequency and Text Extraction

## Description

This script traverses the DOM of a given HTML node (e.g., `document.body`), counts the frequency of all class names, sorts them by their frequency, and then extracts and returns a sentence formed from the text content of elements corresponding to the most frequent classes.

The main goal is to analyze the classes used in a webpage and create a textual sentence based on their frequency, which could be useful for generating summaries, analyzing page content, or understanding class distribution.

## Notes

- The script handles nested elements and text nodes but only extracts text from elements with class names.
- It ensures that text from empty or non-text nodes is not included in the final sentence.
